					The main character of this story is a second year student of Salt Middle School. He is called a "mob" by his neighbors because of his weak presence. He is characterized by his pot head. He likes milk, takoyaki and ramen as his favorite food. The disadvantage is that he is not good at understanding the atmosphere around him.</BR>

He has a gentle personality, pure and enthusiastic, not easily aware of his emotions, resulting in the usual expressionless, emotional expression is not obvious, so few people can understand his thoughts. A powerful superpower, the principle is not to use on people, think superpower is not a necessity of life, many things can not be obtained by superpower, so basically will not use. Because of the fear of losing control of their superpowers and suppressing their emotions, whenever the cumulative value reaches 100%, they will explode and take real action.</BR>

After school, he works part-time at Reimu's psychic talk shop, earning 300 yen an hour (sometimes only food). He loves his teacher Reimu so much that when he receives a phone call from Reimu on a precious holiday, he will come whenever he can. Although I feel disturbed by this and complain verbally, I will go along with Reimu's call out of respect, even though I have not been granted leave. He admires and respects his smart and capable younger brother, Ritsu Kageyama, and is able to apologize and kneel for his brother's sake.</BR>

He is in love with his childhood friend Rei, and joins the flesh transformation club in order to get Rei's admiration. At first, he didn't trust Sakura, but after getting together over time, he seemed to become a good partner. After fighting with Hanazawa, he became the head of the Ripan of Salt Middle School. Because they have been suppressing their superpowers, they could not use them well at first.</BR>

However, he was able to defeat his opponent perfectly with his mere nimble power, but later, as he fought with Claw and other power users, he began to think about other uses of his superpowers and learned to manipulate plants, the ghost body detachment and other skillful abilities; his power is so strong that as long as people are around, even if they do nothing, the average lower level ghosts can not enter his home. When the emotional impact of strong and into a coma, will become "???? The "%" state, when the battle power can instantly kill the top revelation, but the passerby himself does not know.</BR>
